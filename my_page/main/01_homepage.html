        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi there! My name is Nick and I am the designer of this website.
          Although a little older than most students participating on this course I have numerous amounts of experience from working at a number of different job avenues. However, stagnation has lead me into learning again, and with a nudge from a former colleague i have entered myself into the IT world. </p>

        </p>Please use the links to your left to navigate around my website. I hope it is to your satisfaction! Please don't forget about my personal statement link - this  was submitted to Cardiff in 2018 which I hope helps to explain the type of person i am. </p>

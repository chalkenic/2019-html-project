        <p class = "personal_statement">"The primary reason as to why I am applying for university is a lifelong passion of wanting to create developments and solutions, I feel that the digital and underlying computer science principles which are now a massive forefront of our lives something I would be keen to be a part of.""</p>

        <p class = "personal_statement">"My passion for computing started back when I was in pre-school, when my dad found a BBC computing system in a car-boot and wanted to interact with us via early programming concepts from the 80s. ever since this moment I have always in my mind wanted to create a product like this, that could be used and enjoyed by everyone I knew.""</p>

        <p class = "personal_statement">"At the end of my time of education in 2010 I felt I was not ready to move forward academically, due to a need to grow myself personally and professionally, wanting to investigate how the subject matter can used in the professional setting. Joining the workforce after education helped immensely in my understanding of the needs that businesses can require from technology."</p>

        <p class = "personal_statement">"This passion reignited particularly in a current accounting job for a group of sales agencies, where creating automated spreadsheets linking to multiple programs and designing/building phone networks to interlink companies pushed me into rediscovered depths of learning about computing systems. A work colleague then reintroduced me to computer programming (via the C# programming application and learning tools) and I thoroughly enjoyed writing code that could complete tasks, however simple they would be."</p>

        <p class = "personal_statement">Due to now having matured into someone who knows what I personally need to progress further, I knew I could improve at a significantly faster rate with further guidance. Thus, returning into academic study is the best road for me to get the information I need, to take my life where I want it to go in the computing world."</p>

        <p class = "personal_statement">As of this moment I am still working with the companies above but having created automated systems I have been able to reduce my workload to accommodate my studies."</p>

        <p class = "personal_statement">"My social activities would primarily be centred around socialising with friends via both physical and in the gaming world - working as a team to overcome obstacles and challenges and learning to work with others. A main source of my personal development however would come from enjoyment of fitness in my spare time, which I feel helped me greatly in understanding myself and feeling happy and content in my surroundings." </p>
